Here are some Machine Learning projects I have made, following the "Machine Learning Practicum for Physicists" at University of Ljubljana.

Topics (to be completed):
- Regression
- Categorization
- Neural networks
- Recurrent neural networks
- Convolutional neural networks
- Autoencoders
- Clustering
- Mixtures
- Variational autoencoders

Disclaimer: Since I didn't have the course officially, not much effort has been put into reports/code. This serves only for my personal learning of the various methods.
